Frogger Clone
===

Setting up the Game:
---
1. Clone the repository to your computer
2. Run index.html
3. Enjoy!

Gameplay:
---
You've gotta get to the river! Make it across the street without hitting any of the bugs and see how many points you can accumulate before things get crazy fast.

Controls
---
**Keypad** - Move your character!

Known Bugs
---
The game currently doesn't have a reset state. The moment you get hit by a bug the game starts from scratch again. Right now it's a very bare bones game, but I'm hoping to add more to it as I delver deeper into JS.
